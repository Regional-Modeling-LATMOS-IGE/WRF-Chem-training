# Code of conduct for participation in the WRF-Chem training

This code of conduct establishes the standards for expected and unacceptable behavior within the context of the WRF-Chem training at IGE. 

## General Conduct
Individuals participating in the WRF-Chem training are expected to conduct their activities with the utmost integrity and adhere to the highest ethical standards. 
All individuals should be treated with respect, and participants must abstain from any form of discrimination, harassment, or 
bullying during any activity related to the training. In instances where members witness or become aware of such behavior by others, they are requested to actively prevent, 
report, and/or mitigate the offensive conduct.

## Team Interactions
We strive to exhibit considerate speech and actions, actively recognizing and respecting 
the boundaries and experiences of our fellow community members. Specifically, we aim to:
* Respect the time limits and agenda for pre-planned meetings.  
* Uphold honesty, accountability, and transparent communication.
* Refrain from making false or offensive statements and avoid aggressive/passive agressive behaviors.
* Refrain from making personal comments or comments on behavior, focusing on the content and scientific analysis during dicussions.

## Reporting
* All members should report instances of unacceptable conduct promptly to the WRF-Chem training organizers.  
* All information provided will be treated as anonymous and action will be taken to ensure appropriate behavior in team meetings and written interactions going forward.
