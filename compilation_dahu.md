# What we need to compile on Dahu

- What to compile:
  - WPS (currently installed in `/home/marelle-ext/models/WPS/`)
  - WRF-Chem (not installed yet but code is in `/home/marelle-ext/models/WRF/`)
- Where to install: the shared space of the project where we need to compile everything is `/bettik/PROJECTS/pr-regionalchem/`
- Libraries needed for compilation: everything that is currently installed on Dahu in `/home/marelle-ext/tools/lib/`
- WRF-Chem pre-processors to compile - there are 4 pre-processors needed (fire_emis, megan_emiss_bio, mozbc, wes-coldens) which can be found there: `/bettik/PROJECTS/pr-regionalchem/laperer/WRF-preprocessor-code/`

- How Louis compiled WPS on his `/home/`: see document [here](install_WRFChem_dahu.txt)
